MODULE: VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) Distance Sensor Driver (STM32F1 HAL)
================================================================================

1. FILES
--------
- VL53L0X.h : Defines the configuration structures and the API for sensor management.
- VL53L0X.c : Implements I2C communication, sequential initialization for multiple sensors, and signal filtering.

2. HARDWARE SETUP
-----------------
- Sensor Type: VL53L0X Time-of-Flight laser-ranging module.
- Interface: I2C (Default 8-bit address: 0x52).
- Control Pins: Each sensor requires a dedicated XSHUT (Reset/Shutdown) pin to allow for sequential I2C address assignment in multi-sensor configurations.
- Signal Integrity: Features a median-of-three filter to reduce measurement noise across 4 defined sensor channels.

3. FUNCTIONS
------------
- VL53L0X_Init: Powers on a sensor via XSHUT, verifies its ID (0xC0), and optionally assigns a new I2C address to prevent bus conflicts.
- VL53L0X_AllInit: A high-level routine that resets all connected sensors and prepares them for continuous interrupt-driven ranging at a 30ms interval.
- VL53L0X_ReadRange: Retrieves the raw 16-bit distance measurement in millimeters.
- VL53L0X_ReadFiltered: Reads raw data and passes it through a history buffer to calculate a filtered distance value.
- VL53L0X_StartContinuous: Configures the sensor to perform measurements automatically at a set period without constant MCU polling.
- Check_Side: A specialized logic function for robotics that calculates the error/offset from a center line based on left and right distance readings.

4. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
-------------------------
- Sequential Addressing: Because all VL53L0X sensors start with the same I2C address, the driver pulls all XSHUT pins low and then enables/addresses each sensor one by one.
- Error Handling: Returns 8190mm (max range) if the sensor reports 0mm or 20mm, which are typical indicators of a measurement failure or "out of range" condition.
- Interrupts: The driver supports "New Sample Ready" hardware interrupts to allow the MCU to process data only when fresh measurements are available.
